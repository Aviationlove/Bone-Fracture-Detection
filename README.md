# Bone-Fracture-Detection
# Introduction
Bone fractures have long posed diagnostic challenges, traditionally relying on human interpretation of x-rays, which can be prone to error. Recently, AI and machine learning, especially using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG16, have shown potential in accurately classifying fractures. In our research, we have explored and fine-tuned these models, achieving promising, though not yet optimal, results. With further advancements like enhanced feature extraction, AI-based solutions could surpass traditional methods, providing more reliable diagnostics for bone fracture classification in the medical field.
